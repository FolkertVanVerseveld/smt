# Simple Multimedia Toolkit
by Folkert van Verseveld

This toolkit provides simple, but easy support for combining the Simple Direct media Library (SDL) with the following:
* Open Graphics Language (OpenGL)
* Open Audio Language (OpenAL)
* Xorg vorbis library (vorbisfile)
* Portable Network Graphics (libpng)

## Documentation
At the moment, the best documentation are the provided demo examples.
This toolkit assumes you are familiar with OpenGL and OpenAL.

For good pointers how to use the library we recommend to take a look at the demo folder and try to create some new demo's.
See also DEMOS for a brief description about all demo examples.

# Compilation
The following tools are required:
* SDL 2.0
* pkg-config
* GNU Bash
* GNU Make
* gcc

Compiling should be no more than running these commands in a shell:
```
./build
make
```

Compiling the demo examples should be no more then running the following:
```
cd demo
./build && make
```
